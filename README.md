<H1>Hotel Guests Management App</H1>
<p>This project was part of a final exam we had to complete for the iOS course. In this application, the professor provided us with the View Controllers, and we were required to add the remaining components, which included images, buttons, textboxes, labels, etc.</p>
<p>As part of the tasks we had to accomplish, we were required to implement user login validation according to the professor's specifications.</p>
<p>In the SecondViewController, a table will be displayed containing existing guests in the hotel. In this view, there will be a button to add a new guest.</p>
<p>Each guest and their information will be stored in a database to prevent duplications and errors.</p>
